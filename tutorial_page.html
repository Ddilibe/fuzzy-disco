			Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) humans. With great power comes a proportional level of responsibility. Self-driving cars, chatbots, and increasingly accurate predictions of the future are but a few examples of AI's ability to supercharge humankind's capacity for growth and advancement. AI is becoming a core, transformative path that is changing the way we think about every aspect of our lives. It is impacting industry. It is becoming pervasive and embedded in our everyday lives. Most excitingly, this is a field that is still in its infancy: the AI revolution has only just begun. As we collect more and more data and tackle that data with better and faster algorithms, we can use AI to build increasingly accurate models and to answer increasingly complex, previously intractable questions. From this, it will come as no surprise that the ability to work with and fully utilize AI will be a skill that is set only to increase in value. In this book, we explore various real-world scenarios and learn how to apply relevant AI algorithms to a wide swath of problems. The book starts with the most basic AI concepts and progressively builds on these concepts to solve increasingly difficult problems. It will use the initial knowledge gleaned during the beginning chapters as a foundation to allow the reader to explore and tackle some of the more complicated problems in AI. By the end of the book, the reader will and will techniques. We will start by talking about various realms of AI. We'll then move on to discuss more complex algorithms, such as extremely random forests, Hidden Markov Models, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and so on. This book is for Python programmers looking to use AI algorithms to create realworld applications. This book is friendly to Python beginners, but familiarity with Python programming would certainly be helpful so you can play around with the code. It is also useful to experienced Python programmers who are looking to implement artificial intelligence techniques. You will learn how to make informed decisions about the type of algorithms you need to use and how to implement those algorithms to get the best possible results. If you want to build versatile applications that can make sense of images, text, speech, or some other form of data, this book on artificial intelligence will definitelycome to your rescue! This book is for Python developers who want to build real-world artificialintelligence applications. This book is friendly to Python beginners, but beingfamiliar Python would be useful to play around with the code. It will alsobe useful for experienced Python programmers who are looking to use artificial intelligence in their existing technology stacks. Chapter 1, Introduction to Artificial IntelligenceThis chapter provides some basic definitions and groupings that will be usedthroughout the book. It will also an overall classification of the artificialintelligence and machine learning fields as they exist today.Chapter 2, Fundamental Use Cases for Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating topic and a vast field of knowledge. In itscurrent state it generates more questions than it answers, but are certainlymany places where artificial intelligence is being applied, in many instances withoutus even realizing. Before we delve into the fundamental that drive AI,we will analyze some of the most popular use cases for the technology as of today.Chapter 3, Machine Learning PipelinesModel training is a small piece of the machine learning process. Data scientistsoften spend a significant amount of time cleansing, transforming, and preparingdata to get it to be consumed by an AI model. Since data preparation is such atime-consuming activity, we will present state-of-the-art techniques to facilitate as well as other components that a well-designed production data pipelineshould possess
