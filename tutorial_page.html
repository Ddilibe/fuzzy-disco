			Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) humans. With great power comes a proportional level of responsibility.
Self-driving cars, chatbots, and increasingly accurate predictions of the future are
but a few examples of AI's ability to supercharge humankind's capacity for growth
and advancement.
AI is becoming a core, transformative path that is changing the way we think about
every aspect of our lives. It is impacting industry. It is becoming pervasive and
embedded in our everyday lives. Most excitingly, this is a field that is still in its
infancy: the AI revolution has only just begun.
As we collect more and more data and tackle that data with better and faster
algorithms, we can use AI to build increasingly accurate models and to answer
increasingly complex, previously intractable questions.
From this, it will come as no surprise that the ability to work with and fully utilize
AI will be a skill that is set only to increase in value. In this book, we explore various
real-world scenarios and learn how to apply relevant AI algorithms to a wide swath
of problems.
The book starts with the most basic AI concepts and progressively builds on these
concepts to solve increasingly difficult problems. It will use the initial knowledge
gleaned during the beginning chapters as a foundation to allow the reader to explore
and tackle some of the more complicated problems in AI. By the end of the book, the
reader will and will techniques.
We will start by talking about various realms of AI. We'll then move on to discuss
more complex algorithms, such as extremely random forests, Hidden Markov
Models, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, convolutional neural
networks, and so on.
This book is for Python programmers looking to use AI algorithms to create realworld applications. This book is friendly to Python beginners, but familiarity with
Python programming would certainly be helpful so you can play around with
the code. It is also useful to experienced Python programmers who are looking to
implement artificial intelligence techniques.
You will learn how to make informed decisions about the type of algorithms you
need to use and how to implement those algorithms to get the best possible results.
If you want to build versatile applications that can make sense of images, text,
speech, or some other form of data, this book on artificial intelligence will definitely
come to your rescue!

This book is for Python developers who want to build real-world artificial
intelligence applications. This book is friendly to Python beginners, but being
familiar with Python would be useful to play around with the code. It will also
be useful for experienced Python programmers who are looking to use artificial
intelligence techniques in their existing technology stacks.

Chapter 1, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This chapter provides some basic definitions and groupings that will be used
throughout the book. It will also provide an overall classification of the artificial
intelligence and machine learning fields as they exist today.
Chapter 2, Fundamental Use Cases for Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating topic and a vast field of knowledge. In its
current state it generates more questions than it answers, but there are certainly
many places where artificial intelligence is being applied, in many instances without
us even realizing. Before we delve into the fundamental algorithms that drive AI,
we will analyze some of the most popular use cases for the technology as of today.
Chapter 3, Machine Learning Pipelines
Model training is only a small piece of the machine learning process. Data scientists
often spend a significant amount of time cleansing, transforming, and preparing
data to get it ready to be consumed by an AI model. Since data preparation is such a
time-consuming activity, we will present state-of-the-art techniques to facilitate this
activity as well as other components that a well-designed production data pipeline
should possess
